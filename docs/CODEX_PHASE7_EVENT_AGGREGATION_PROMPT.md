# CODEX PROMPT — EXAMGUARD PHASE 7 CALIBRATION + EVENT FSM

You are continuing the existing ExamGuard repository.

Existing pipeline:

```text
Video
→ YOLO11n
→ ByteTrack
→ Seat-Stable Identity
→ Proposal Builder
→ Temporal Buffer
→ TSM R3
→ ActionPrediction
```

Phase 6.5 PERFORMANCE PASS is complete on GTX1650.

Implement Phase 7 only:

```text
ActionPrediction
→ runtime calibration
→ temporal smoothing
→ hysteresis
→ Event FSM
→ cross-proposal deduplication
→ AI Event + EventActor
```

Do NOT implement Evidence, Review UI, Appeal, Head Pose, Desk/Object or Reports.

```

Before editing:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -15
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Preserve valid uncommitted work.

# 2. Do not modify working Phase 6 contract

Do not change without a concrete bug:

```text
TSM checkpoint
8-frame contract
224x224
RGB
normalization
class order
timestamp sampling
Single/Pair proposal identity
GTX1650 FP32 scheduler profile
```

# 3. Scope

Implement:

```text
7A Runtime Calibration
7B Smoothing + Event FSM
7C Dedup + Event Persistence
```

Do not invent thresholds before calibration.

# 4. Behavior routing baseline

Use:

```text
SINGLE
→ suspicious_looking
→ using_phone/cheat_sheet

PAIR
→ communicating
→ exchange_object
```

`normal` never creates Event.

Raw TSM remains 5-class.

# 5. Build calibration pipeline

Build/reuse a CLI/script that runs the actual production runtime path over labeled development/validation videos:

```text
YOLO
→ ByteTrack
→ Seat Identity
→ Proposal Builder
→ Dynamic Runtime ROI
→ TSM R3
→ ActionPrediction
```

Do not calibrate only with old annotation ROI evaluation.

Purpose: measure runtime distribution shift.

# 6. Development/final-test separation

Inspect manifests/splits.

Do not use final-test labels in threshold or FSM parameter search.

Record exactly which sessions/videos/events are calibration data.

# 7. Export ActionPrediction calibration artifacts

Export fields such as:

```text
session_id
video_id
timestamp_ms
proposal_id
proposal_type
session_candidate_ids
seat_codes

prob_normal
prob_suspicious_looking
prob_communicating
prob_exchange_object
prob_using_phone_cheat_sheet

top_class
top_confidence

matched_gt_event_id
matched_gt_behavior
```

Use JSONL/CSV/Parquet according to project conventions.

Do not persist raw predictions to PostgreSQL.

# 8. Ground-truth alignment

Define exact prediction-to-GT alignment using:

```text
session/video
timestamp
behavior
actor identity where available
```

Pair GT should require compatible actor pair when annotations support it.

Document unmatched predictions.

# 9. Raw metrics

Produce:

```text
per-class Precision
Recall
F1
Macro F1
Weighted F1
confusion matrix
```

Also inspect positive/negative probability distributions per behavior where practical.

# 10. Implement streaming smoother

Preferred baseline:

```text
EMA
```

Use only current/past predictions.

Make alpha configurable.

Reset on:

```text
seek
proposal expiry
large discontinuity
runtime reset
```

# 11. Add event detection config

Add centralized config:

```yaml
event_detection:
  enabled: false

  suspicious_looking:
    proposal_types: [SINGLE]
    smoothing:
      type: ema
      alpha: ...
    start_threshold: ...
    keep_threshold: ...
    min_active_ms: ...
    end_grace_ms: ...
    merge_gap_ms: ...

  communicating:
    proposal_types: [PAIR]
    ...

  exchange_object:
    proposal_types: [PAIR]
    ...

  using_phone_cheat_sheet:
    proposal_types: [SINGLE]
    ...
```

Final values must come from calibration.

# 12. Parameter search

Implement a bounded reproducible search over development/validation.

Tune per behavior:

```text
EMA alpha
start_threshold
keep_threshold
min_active_ms
end_grace_ms
merge_gap_ms optional
```

Primary objective:

```text
event-level F1 / Macro Event F1
```

Monitor:

```text
false events/min
Recall
duplicate rate
```

Avoid huge search spaces.

# 13. Hysteresis

Normally require:

```text
start_threshold > keep_threshold
```

Do not create Event from one score crossing a single threshold.

# 14. Event FSM

One FSM per:

```text
proposal_id + behavior
```

States:

```text
IDLE
CANDIDATE
ACTIVE
COOLDOWN
```

Use runtime domain types, not ORM as state.

# 15. IDLE → CANDIDATE

When smoothed score reaches start evidence.

Track:

```text
candidate_start_ms
peak probability
peak timestamp
evidence
```

No DB write.

# 16. CANDIDATE → ACTIVE

Require sustained evidence for:

```text
min_active_ms
```

Use source/action timestamps, never wall clock.

Effective Event start should reflect sustained evidence beginning.

# 17. CANDIDATE → IDLE

If evidence collapses before minimum duration:

discard candidate.

No Event row.

Increment suppression diagnostic.

# 18. ACTIVE → COOLDOWN

When score falls below keep evidence.

Record last valid active timestamp.

Do not close immediately.

# 19. COOLDOWN → ACTIVE

If evidence recovers before:

```text
end_grace_ms
```

resume same Event.

No second Event.

# 20. COOLDOWN → CLOSED

If low evidence persists through grace:

finalize candidate Event.

Use timestamp boundary rules from context.

# 21. Event confidence

Track:

```text
mean active probability
peak probability
peak timestamp
prediction count
```

Use:

```text
ai_confidence = mean active probability
```

unless project schema already specifies another documented rule.

# 22. Normal regression rule

Explicitly test:

```text
normal never creates Event
```

# 23. Proposal/behavior routing regression

Baseline:

```text
SINGLE communicating → no Event
SINGLE exchange_object → no Event

PAIR suspicious_looking → no Event
PAIR using_phone_cheat_sheet → no Event
```

Raw predictions remain available for calibration/debug.

# 24. Pair interaction persistence

For:

```text
pair:SC103:SC104
```

communicating/exchange creates:

```text
one Event
two EventActors
```

Do not create duplicate one-person Events.

# 25. Cross-proposal dedup

Implement deterministic dedup after candidate Event finalization.

Use:

```text
behavior
actor set
temporal overlap / short gap
```

Prefer exact actor-set equality baseline.

Do not merge unrelated nearby candidates.

# 26. Event persistence

Inspect existing `events` and `event_actors`.

Create AI Event using current schema:

```text
source = AI
status = PENDING_REVIEW
behavior
start_ms
end_ms
peak_ms
ai_confidence
session_id
```

Create EventActors from SessionCandidate IDs.

Never set CONFIRMED automatically.

# 27. No raw-prediction DB table

Do not create:

```text
action_predictions
model_predictions
frame_predictions
```

tables.

# 28. Idempotency

Protect Event persistence from duplicate callbacks/retries/runtime duplication.

Use existing service patterns.

Do not add arbitrary DB uniqueness constraints without analysis.

# 29. Pause

Pause must not advance CANDIDATE/COOLDOWN by wall clock.

# 30. Seek

On arbitrary seek reset:

```text
smoothers
FSMs
candidate event state
cooldowns
pending dedup state
```

Do not persist partial pre-seek candidate events.

Finalized historical Events remain.

# 31. Stop

Recommended policy:

```text
ACTIVE
→ finalize at last valid evidence timestamp

CANDIDATE below minimum
→ discard
```

Document exact behavior.

# 32. Event-level evaluation

Implement predicted-event matching against GT.

Require:

```text
same behavior
compatible actor set
sufficient temporal overlap
```

Define and document temporal criterion.

Report:

```text
TP
FP
FN
Precision
Recall
F1
per-class Event F1
Macro Event F1
false events/minute
duplicate event rate
```

Do not silently tune evaluation tolerance to improve metrics.

# 33. Selected config artifact

Create:

```text
selected_event_thresholds.yaml
```

or equivalent.

For each behavior report:

```text
alpha
start threshold
keep threshold
min active ms
end grace ms
merge gap if used

validation Precision
Recall
F1
false events/min
```

# 34. Final-test discipline

After selected config is frozen:

optionally run final test once if data/environment permit.

Clearly separate:

```text
calibration/development
vs
final test
```

Do not retune after final-test result.

# 35. RBAC

AI Event creation is internal system behavior.

Do not pretend AI is Supervisor/Reviewer.

Existing user permissions remain unchanged.

# 36. Diagnostics

Add:

```text
candidate_fsms
active_fsms
cooldown_fsms

events_created_total
events_suppressed_total
events_deduplicated_total

per_behavior_event_count
```

No frame-level DB logging.

# 37. Unit tests

Add tests for:

```text
normal never creates Event

single suspicious sustained → one Event
single phone sustained → one Event

pair communicating sustained → one Event + two actors
pair exchange sustained → one Event + two actors

one spike → no Event
brief drop → same Event
long drop → closes Event
cooldown recovery → same Event

invalid proposal/behavior routing → no Event

seek reset
pause timestamp behavior
stop ACTIVE flush
insufficient CANDIDATE discard

true duplicate → dedup
different actors → no dedup
```

# 38. Calibration tests

Verify:

```text
final test excluded from search
search reproducible
GT actor/time alignment correct
invalid annotations reported
```

# 39. Static checks

Run repository-standard:

```text
pytest
ruff
mypy
```

Only run frontend tests/build if frontend changed.

# 40. Reports

Create:

```text
docs/PHASE7_EVENT_AGGREGATION_REPORT.md
```

Update:

```text
CURRENT_STATE.md
SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md
CONFIG_SPEC.md
```

Report calibration data, search space, selected parameters, raw metrics, Event metrics and known failure modes.

# 41. Do not implement

Do NOT add:

```text
Head Pose
Desk/Object detector
new TSM architecture
retraining
Evidence generation
Event Review UI
Appeal
Reports engine
notifications
```

Stop at AI Event creation.

# 42. Definition of Done

Set:

```text
PHASE 7: PASS
```

only if:

```text
runtime calibration completed on development/validation
per-class config selected reproducibly
normal never creates Event
proposal/behavior routing enforced
FSM timestamp-based
single spikes suppressed
